# Instagram 19th June 2019

Again, thank you for all the celebrations of today's 1st EP 'Principal' release!

Finally, finally, the CD can be sent to everyone; I feel a little relieved.

Furthermore, 4th in the daily rankings â€” I'm so surprised with that number I can't hide my joy. To have it reach that many peopleâ€¦ I feel so much gratitude.

I think of this as a present that everyone gave me without a doubt. Honestly, honestly, thank you.

Until now, starting my solo career, I wasn't sure of myself and I was always feeling uneasy. However from today, I have this "Principle"; I thought I'd try living a bit more proudly.

These kind of things that I thought of, is thanks to you guys.
You're always giving me so much. Truly.

While not losing who I am, I want to keep growing and keep changing aspects I can.

Not forgetting the feeling of challenging things, those at DMM music who chose me â€” let's continue to make beautiful work together!! Continuing on, there is another release event next month so I am looking forward to meeting you guys ðŸŽ‰

By the way, today's outfit was #ROSEBUD ðŸŒ¹ #June19
