# Val×Love End-of-year Party (Instagram 8th December 2019)

Yesterday, I attended the ‘Val×Love Big End-of-year Party’!

There were lots of things; music performances, talks and dramatic readings 👏

I sang ‘for…’ as the OP of the event! I was happy that even though there were probably many first-timers, they all got lively for me 😿

It was a long time since I saw the actors but I again felt how close everyone was to each other. During singing rehearsals, they would also sit right in front to support me and just before the performance, as I was shivering from the cold, Natsuki's Kaede-chan warmed me up lol. This work has a good team behind it ☺️ Two more episodes of the Anime left! Watch until the end 👏

Yesterday's dress was a black dress in Shino-chan's style 👗
I saw it by chance and immediately purchased it 😌
The clothes here were cute
For the music part, this is the outfit I wore in the ‘for…’ music video!
