# Anime NYC

Came back safely yesterday ✈️

It was cold! I feel like Japan's warmth is like a tropical country 🌴

Thank you so much to those who came to watch!

Long ago, I would never think that just Guilty Kiss would be able to perform in a concert overseas. It was my first time in NY, and being able to perform a concert in a place like that, I think it was a good experience. Some day, with all 9 of Aqours! I thought 😸

Thanks to the other two members, it turned into a fun trip 🗽 Even went sightseeing…!

I bought lots of things so I'll post another update 🛍
