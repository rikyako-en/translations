# Aqours Dome Tour Cancellation

It's not like I want to tell everyone about something negative; I tried not to but please let me express my thoughts as they are now.

Over these several days, I haven't been able to sort out my feelings. It's like my heart has been ripped open.

About the cancellation of the dome tour, I still can't believe it. When not being able to see what the future holds, we had this live so I felt I could positively look ahead and keep at it. Now that it's gone, I don't where to look to move forward.

I am perplexed at that such weakness of my heart too.

There is understanding but its existence was a very big deal for me.

I still haven't caught up with my feelings but it was live that could only be done with the safety of the cast and staff.

Moreover, in the current situation, I only have gratitude to the staff for somehow letting us get on stage in audienceless form.

<p>&nbsp;</p>

Also above all, I feel pain for making those who were anticipating it to feel sad.

We too, feel the same as everyone right now.

Until the very end, we were making tons of preparations for the live.

The feelings I want to deliver to everyone still remain as they are. They probably won't go away.

<p>&nbsp;</p>

Therefore, please wait.

I too, shall believe in the words of the staff when they say there definitely will another live and I will do my best at what I can do now.

It might just be a small bump in the road but I believe the things we have built up to now will not be lost.

Furthermore, separate from the dome tour, we will have a streamed live in October!!!

The name of it is ~LOST WORLD~!!

Because of where we are now, there must always be something we can transmit. What I say might be strange but those who were looking forward to it; please do not lose heartâ€¦

Believe that someday, we will be able to hold a dome tour with an audience.

Because up to now, with everyone, we've overcome lots of various challenges together! From hereon, I will properly try my best to look forward positively!!

Thank you for reading until the end ðŸ˜Š

See you later!
