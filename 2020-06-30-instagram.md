# Aqours' 5th Anniversary

Again, today, 30th June, we welcome five years since the formation of Aqours 🌸🌸

Thank you so much for all the congratulatory messages!

<p>&nbsp;</p>

I have received so my precious things from Love Live! Sunshine!! and also Aqours. These five years have become an unchangeable period in my life.

Riko Sakurauchi; the members who are like family to me now; the team of Love Live! who are always by our side, supporting us and also everyone as the 10th person!! We had lots of encounters!!! I am really so glad to have met everyone!! Because everyone was there, we were able to overcome anything. We've been trying hard to get here.

We're here today because of everyone's love for Aqours. Honestly, thank you.

We've experienced so many things over these five years but we, Aqours, still have so many things we want to do. We are bursting with aspirations. I want to stand on stage again with the nine of us! The day that we will be able to see each other is definitely coming, so absolutely wait for it!

The days where we cannot meet are still continuing but I feel like the memories born in these five years gives me courage. Therefore I can give it my all!! I will do my best until the day I can see everyone!

Continuing from here, I'd be happy if you unchangingly continue to love Aqours ☺️

Even after this 5<sup>th</sup> anniversary, we will do our best without stopping so treat us well!
