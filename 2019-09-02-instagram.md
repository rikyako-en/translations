# Anisama 2019

Animelo Summer Live 2019 "STORY"

On Day 1, I performed as Rikako Aida! It was over… Really, in a blink of an eye…
I sang the ED of the TV Anime “Senryuu Girl”, “ORDINARY LOVE”.

It would be the first time that I would stand alone on such a big stage so to be honest, I was actually very scared.

When the Anisama performances were decided, I did not yet have the confidence that I could do it, so I was thinking that it would be OK if August never came around. lol

Almost everyday, I'd have dreams where the lyrics were different, that I would make mistakes. There was a time when anxieties about whether the crowd would accept me felt crushing. I believe that that I managed to stand up on that stage and sing because of all your support.

Truly, truly, I have so much gratitude. I felt the blessing of everyone again. In the middle of singing, I saw some people who were wearing the Us uniform which made me so happy I was on the verge of crying but I managed to hold it in. lol There were also many people who wore the Principal T-shirt too 😊 Furthermore, despite that fact that I think there were many people who didn't know me, I was so happy that the crowd was waving their beautiful pink-colored pen lights for me. Any color would have been OK. Since I said to wave any color. The venue's united feeling of expressed happiness calmed me down.

At that moment, I believe “confidence” and  “resolve” must have swelled within me.

It happened in an instant but I believe that the moment where I sung ”ORDINARY LOVE“ is something I will never forget. I'm glad to have met such a lovely song ☺️

Furthermore, to the stylist who handmade the marvellous, beautiful, beautiful outfit; to the makeup artist who — by trial and error — made my hair glow in such a big place; to everyone at my music label who always support me; to all the staff at Ken Productions; I gathered all the feelings of everyone and took them to the stage with me. Again, I am grateful to have been able to stand in such a beautiful place. I really felt that it was a day of everyone's support.

On Day 2, I performed as a member of Aqours!

This year would already be the third time…

This Anisama was the last time that the nine of us would stand on a stage together this year so we all went for with our thoughts as one.

This year, we sang “Bokura no Hashittekita Michi wa…”, “Aozora Jumping Heart”, “Omoi yo Hitotsu ni Nare” and “Yuuki wa Doko ni? Kimi no Mune ni!”. It was a setlist tightly-packed with Aqours' STORY thus far 😊

I was surprised when I heard that the Anisama producer wanted us to sing Omoi yo Hitotsu ni Nare.

Since it's a song we, Aqours and the fans put together, I wondered if just  watching the performance, it would come across to those who didn't know us.

However, without those things, it's a really good song; that at least I can say for certain. So simply, I was very happy that the nine of us could sing a song I love 😊🌸

I'd be happy if we managed to convey even at least a little of the four-year STORY of Aqours.

The Anisama stage for these two days was supposedly the same but the views I was able to see were completely different. However both as solo and as Aqours, that place has a special place in my heart. I will continue to strongly confront new challenges and do my best!

We're already into September, right…!
With Anisama over, my summer is over 😉 lol
<br/><br/>

I want to wear autumn and winter clothes soon….
