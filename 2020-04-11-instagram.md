Today was supposed to be the day that the curtain would raise on the 1st live tour â€˜Curtain raiseâ€™.

You were all looking forward to it, weren't you.

Looking at my timeline, I know that there are many listening to the album at home.

Thanks so much!! It's sad that we can't hold the concert but I feel a little piece of mind not exposing everyone to danger.

At any rate, we still have life.

As long as I'm alive, I will definitely be able to see everyone again and be able to have fun times!

I'm sure there are many people worried about whether we will be able to return to life like before or whether daily life has changed but even if it takes time, we should slowly make our lives normal again; that's how I'm thinking. To your own normal life!

For that reason, a little self-restraint now ðŸ˜Š

<p>&nbsp;</p>

For the hope that I can see the precious people to me again,  
I want to completely take care of my health.

Because it's not only my own life anymore.

I don't want to see any sad faces of those around me either,  
so for that reason I will properly take care of myself.

I'm going to listen to album lots today!! #Curtainraise
