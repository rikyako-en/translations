# 2019 ‚Üí 2020

Only a little bit left of this year.

Last year's New Year's Eve was all over the place but this year I am relaxing at home.

There's good points about each right.

As you all know in the last few years, it was always Aqours day in day out, no time to stop or look back, just desperate to tackle the challenges ahead but‚Ä¶

With the first half of this year of the Fan Meeting Tour, Asia Tour, 5th live and also my solo career, it really was a rollercoaster time for the mind and body.

I think everyone was feeling it too, the 5th live was the last big live as Aqours in 2019! (Though we had appearances on TV, Anisama, etc.)

This time there was no big announcement during the live. When I was on stage, I personally was like is Aqours really over?

I felt lonely, waking up from a delusion.

Since there was always opportunities for us to be up on stage as 9 until now.

Therefore, I had a lot of time since June to look at Aqours with myself. I think it was good for me.

My solo career was kicked up a gear: 1st Ep ‚ÄòPricipal‚Äô _[sic]_ and 1st Single ‚Äòfor‚Ä¶‚Äô were released; performing at Anisama; I have to face things that I have ran from until now.

Through various things, I felt my weaknesses and helplessness more than ever. However more than that, with the help lots of people, I fully realized my support.

With all things that happened, my values and way of thinking changed and again, I was reminded of my gratitude for Aqours' existance.

It was not something so obvious.

There might be some things I forgot even if I didn't mean to.

It was that kind of year!

I shall welcome 2020, holding the essential things, weaknesses and anxieties and leaving all the superfluous things.

Next year, my first album will be released, and also my first one-man concert has been confirmed! I think that day will come soon so I want to properly do what I can now!

Extremely beautiful songs have been written for me. So please do look forward to it üëè

I am nervous for the one-man concert alone but there are people who believe in me so no more complaining! I'll do my best to make it a concert that leaves a lasting impression on everyone!

<p>&nbsp;</p>

Also, I can't forget this.

2020 is Aqours 5th Aniversary. üéâ

During the 5th live MC, did you remember it being said that there may be continued days where we can't meet but please always love Aqours!??

There may be lots of people with uneasy thoughts of this but Aqours is not ending and there are no ending plans. Won't one already stop expecting a final live some day?? I don't know what will happen in the future but like Aqours, we will keep moving forward on the path just for us.

Personally for 2020, I want the year to be a year of rejuvenation as Aqours. I want us to try something new since our formation 5 years ago!! It's been a long time‚Ä¶

There was lots I wanted to tell everyone this year üòä

Thank you for reading until the end!!

Let's meet in 2020!!
