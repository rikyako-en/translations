# 1st photo book (Instagram 11th November 2019)

Again, on 25th December, the 1st photo book will be released!

Unpublished cuts from Seiyu Animedia series â€™RIKAKO's FILMâ€˜ and new shots fill this one volume to the brim ðŸ“¸

None of the photos in this magazine have been used ðŸ‘€ Amazing!

The cover and the layout have already been decided; only the beautiful photos are left to decideâ€¦

The included interviews took about 7 hours to do. lol

I absolutely definitely want everyone to read this meticulously crafted book.

When I was looking at the layouts recently, I was so moved I criedâ€¦ I hope our feelings come across to everyone. It's still a little while before it's released but do look forward to it coming out ðŸŽ‰
