# Fan Meeting vol.1

Rikako Aida OFFICIAL FAN MEETING ‘with Us’ vol.1 🎉

Thank you for the great time everyone!

I was so happy to get so many flowers too 💐

This time I performed ‘FUTURE LINE’ as the OP and in the second half concert portion, 1st Single ‘for…’ coupling song, ’Contrast‘ for the first time 🎤

As expected, concerts are nerve-wracking… however!

I think I was able to have a really fun performance 🙂 I have strong feelings like “I always want to fulfill everyone's expectations of enjoyment!!”. I always receive so much from everyone everytime. Truly, truly thank you.

Also announced this time was,

<p>&nbsp;</p>

I'm so happy to finally be able to announce it.

I have strong feelings like “I have to do my best!” 👏

I will again untiringly do my best to be able to deliver some great works for everyone.

Also also, my first one-man concerts as a hall tour! I'll be going to see everyone!

I still can't believe that I will be able to do concerts in such wonderful venues but one step at a time, I'll steadily get closer to it.

However, I wouldn't be able to do it by myself.

I'd like it if that with everyone as ‘Us’, we make it a wonderful space ☺️ So definitely do come along!

I'm really looking forward to it!! Priority registration has started on the Us website so definitely do check it out 🏠 #RikakoAida
