# Instagram 16th June 2019

Thank you for the amazing time today ‚òª

Following on from the 12th, I really enjoyed being able to talk a lot with everyone!

Thank you for sharing your thoughts and feelings. I feel like I received a lot of energy from everyone today: ‚ÄúI'll go to Anisama to support you!‚Äù; ‚ÄúI believe in you so it will be fine!‚Äù and such.

Everyone has burdens to carry I think ‚Äî some of them said that work was draining, or that they had exams coming up ‚Äî but because we shared that time together, if you feel like you can now try to give it just a little more, I'd be happy. With life, isn't it a trivial thing that can change for good or for bad in a big way.

I'm still a beginner but even if it's me, I thought it would be nice to give a small push to someone and when you're at the event, to be able to forget your everyday problems and enjoy it.

From now, through songs and through works as a voice actress, I will give 110% so that I can convey more and more of my feelings to everyone!

I'd be happy if you could watch over me.

The next time I meet everyone will be on _Principal_'s release day; the 19th! üéâ

I'm looking forward to be able to spend such an important day for me with everyone!

Ah, today's outfit was #beamsboy ~
