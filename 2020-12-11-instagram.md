# Curtain raise Live Tour

Finally, starting tomorrow,

The 1st LIVE TOUR 2020-2021 “Curtain raise” will start! The curtain is finally going to rise...!

I'm going to see everyone in Nagoya!

It's my first full live by myself and I'm really nervous about the tour but I'm more excited now to see everyone again.

During the performance, you may not be able to speak and it may be constrained but I'd be happy if we follow the rules and have a great time!!

I'm going to stand on stage, grateful to be able to perform the live and to see you all!

Almost there! Wait for me!
